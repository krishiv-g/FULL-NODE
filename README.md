This guide outlines the steps required to deploy a full STEEM node, ensuring a streamlined process for any operating system that supports Docker and Docker Compose.

### System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Any, with Docker and Docker Compose
- **Storage:** At least 10 TB SSD
- **Memory:** 512 GB RAM
- **CPU:** 64 CORE CPU

### Quick Start

1. Fork and clone this repository into your system.
2. Rename the cloned repository to `FULL-NODE` and place it under `/home`.
3. In the `FULL-NODE` directory, run `docker-compose up -d`.

> **Note:** This will start syncing from block 1. For a faster setup, download block logs from [Steem backup data server](https://files.steem.fans/).
